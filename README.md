## Hi, I'm Michael

I'm a Computer Science major and Senior Student IT Technician with a passion for technology and problem-solving. Currently, I'm focused on expanding my skills in full-stack development as I work through the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I’m building a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end web development. 

Always eager to learn, I'm excited to apply my experience and continue growing as a developer in an ever-evolving field.
